# Hacking Challenge 
### Boutique, Fashion & Clothes 
#### Digital Retail challenge


The system described below is the one required to achieve our objectives as a startup fashion company, it must provide capabilities that allow our customers to find, select and view details of our products and share them in their social media networks. 

On the other hand this system must allow our employees to create, update, and delete products as well create, update and delete promotions for discounts only. 

Lastly an analytics module is required to see most visited products from the catalog.

This document along with its references provides a complete description of the required system capabilities. It also includes some expectations of the design for the pages to be developed. 

Styles are not included in the pages below it is up to the squads to give some beauty to the system.

Some of the screens/figures may include generic information but at the end such information is essentially equal from the actual ones.

## 6. Stack of Technologies
It's recommended to use the new frameworks based on component development such as React or Angular.

It's also recommended to implement a state management system for the data and shopping cart.

One of the requirements of the MVP is to create a responsive application so you can implement bootstrap or flexbox or whatever framework for UI responsiveness.

The only required browser to make the project work is Chrome.

Use github for your code repository.

It's acceptable to present your system running locally however if you are in good shape to deploy then talk to your mentor to check the available infrastructure for deployment.
